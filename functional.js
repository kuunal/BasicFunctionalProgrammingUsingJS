// Functional Programming is a programming paradigms or styles 
// just like OOP. It is just decomposing of problems into small
// and reuseable functions that take some input and returns result.


// Characteristics of FP
// Functions should be first class citizens i.e functions 
// should be objects and hence can be passed as agrument to another functin
// or can be assign to variable and can be returned from another function.
// They don't mutate or change data.
// funciton should not have any side effects i.e It should not change 
// state of application.
// it should not depend upon anything rather than input parameters
// It should not mutate state of object, var, arrays or other datatypes
// Mutation is done on new obejct or new variables, avoiding changing 
// existing var or object. For that various libraries can be used Eg
// Immutable by FB, Immer, etc. Basic JS like spread operator, 
// array method like filter, map, reduce, slice, etc can also be used.
